Object Relational Mapping
============================

`Object Relational Mapping <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping>`_ (ORM) in
computer software is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible
type systems in databases and object-oriented programming languages.

There are two famous ORM for Python: SQLAlchemy__ and Django__ models.
Both of them are fully feature open-source libraries with an incredible community
of users and developers.
At the moment, they are best suited for for traditional
`relational databases <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database>`_ back-ends.
